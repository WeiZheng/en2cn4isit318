Basic instructions of minor version update for Dummies (http://drupal.org/node/1223018)

I am a fairly technical person, however Drupal is a beast and unless you immerse yourself in it for a few hours, just following basic instructions can be a challenge.

So I immersed myself in it and came up with this basic plan for updating. I had a basic installation, and all changes I've made have been through modules. I haven't edited any individual files to customize them.

1. Backup your DB (I used the Backup and Migrate module - follow instructions for that)
2. Using any file manager (I used my FTP client), change your /sites folder name to /Save
3. Unpackage the update file on your local PC into a folder called 7.12
4. Use an FTP client (such as Filezilla) and copy everything from the 7.12 local folder into the folder you have drupal installed in (ie, you should see /sites, /modules, /themes, etc to know you're in the right folder)
5. Use the overwrite function on your file copy - this will overwrite everything
6. Delete the new /sites folder
7. Rename the /Save folder to /sites
8. Go to www..com/update.php and follow the instructions.

Worked well for me. I did it this way since I saw several references to NOT needing to delete all core files when doing a minor update (ie, 7.xx to 7.xx). I felt safer doing it this way.
